Textures obtained from: `https://www.solarsystemscope.com/textures/`

## TODO

  [x] - Sun, with some surface noise
  [x] - Earth and it's atmosphere with lighting
  [x] - Slow down the speed of the scene
  [x] - Add stars with actual flikering objects (use instanced meshes and shaders) (still sampling textures, but done with a shader and added slight twinkling)
  [x] - Add other planets and their orbits (rough sketch) -- only mercury and venus are done
  [x] - Kepler's laws for orbits
  [ ] - Realistic orbit and rotational speeds for all planets
  [ ] - Fix the camera follwing and options
  [ ] - Add moons for the other planets
  [ ] - Polish the rest of the planets and whatever custom trait they have
  [ ] - Shadow casting for the planets using shaders
  [ ] - Fix the sun atmosphere
  [ ] - Fix UV wrapping for the sun (handle spherical coordinates)
  [ ] - Add some a lens flare for the sun

  [ ] - Exploration mode with a spaceship with a third person camera, like a game. (must be the normandy)
  [ ] - Information tooltip when the planets are clicked?
  [ ] - Solar flares, comets, comet trails, asteroid belts
  [ ] - Multiplayer?
  [ ] - Accessibility options? screen readers maybe.
