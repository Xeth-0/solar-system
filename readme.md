# Solar System - w/Three.js and Shaders

  textures from: https://www.solarsystemscope.com/textures/

## TODO

[x] - Slow down the speed of the scene
[x] - Add stars with actual flikering objects (use instanced meshes and shaders) (still sampling textures, but done with a shader and added slight twinkling)
[ ] - Add other planets and their orbits (rough sketch)
[ ] - Kepler's laws for orbits
[ ] - Fix UV wrapping for the sun (handle spherical coordinates)
[ ] - Add moons
[ ] - Fix the sun atmosphere
